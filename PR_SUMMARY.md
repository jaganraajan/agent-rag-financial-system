# Pull Request Summary: Iterative Query Decomposition

## Overview

This PR implements **iterative (looped) query decomposition** that enables compound queries where the output of initial sub-queries informs the generation and execution of follow-up sub-queries.

## Problem Statement

Previously, the system could handle comparative queries like "Which company had the highest revenue in 2024?" but could not handle compound questions that require follow-up based on the initial results, such as:

> "Which company had the highest revenue in 2024? **What are the main AI risks of that company?**"

The system needed to:
1. Execute comparative queries across companies
2. Determine the "winner"
3. Dynamically generate and execute a follow-up query using the winner
4. Return complete results showing all sub-queries

## Solution

Implemented a multi-stage iterative orchestration system:

### Stage 1: Detection
- Detects compound queries with comparative + follow-up + AI intent
- Extracts year information (defaults to 2024)

### Stage 2: Initial Execution
- Decomposes into comparative sub-queries (e.g., "MSFT revenue 2024")
- Executes retrieval for all companies
- Synthesizes results to identify winner

### Stage 3: Iterative Follow-up
- Generates follow-up query using winner: "{WINNER} ai strategy {year}"
- Executes follow-up retrieval
- Appends to sub_queries list

### Stage 4: Final Synthesis
- Re-synthesizes using ALL results (initial + follow-up)
- Routes through _synthesize_ai_strategy for AI-focused answer
- Returns JSON with complete sub_queries list

## Key Changes

### Core Implementation (3 files modified)

1. **`src/agents/synthesis_engine.py`**
   - Added `metadata` field to `SynthesisResult` dataclass
   - Populated `metadata['winner_company']` in comparative synthesis

2. **`src/agents/enhanced_rag.py`**
   - Added `_detect_compound_query_with_followup()` method
   - Added `_extract_year_from_query()` method
   - Implemented iterative logic in `query()` method
   - Enhanced `_synthesize_cross_company_comparison()` with winner detection

3. **`src/agents/query_decomposer.py`**
   - Prioritized comparative pattern matching for proper classification

### Testing & Documentation (5 files created)

1. **`test_compound_query.py`** - Unit tests (5/5 passing)
2. **`test_integration_compound.py`** - Integration test (PASSING)
3. **`demo_compound_query.py`** - Interactive demonstration
4. **`TESTING.md`** - Comprehensive testing guide
5. **`IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`** - Detailed technical documentation

## Example Output

### Input
```
"Which company had the highest revenue in 2024? What are the main AI risks of that company?"
```

### JSON Output
```json
{
  "query": "Which company had the highest revenue in 2024? What are the main AI risks of that company?",
  "sub_queries": [
    "MSFT revenue 2024",
    "GOOGL revenue 2024",
    "NVDA revenue 2024",
    "GOOGL ai strategy 2024"    ‚Üê Follow-up appended!
  ],
  "answer": "[Combined answer addressing both revenue comparison and AI risks]",
  "reasoning": "Synthesized AI strategy comparison using LLM from 4 sub-query answers.",
  "sources": [
    {"company": "NVDA", "year": "2024", "excerpt": "Total revenue of $60.9 billion..."},
    {"company": "MSFT", "year": "2024", "excerpt": "Total revenue of $245.1 billion..."},
    {"company": "GOOGL", "year": "2024", "excerpt": "Total revenue of $328.3 billion..."},
    {"company": "GOOGL", "year": "2024", "excerpt": "Our AI strategy focuses on..."}  ‚Üê Follow-up data!
  ]
}
```

## Testing

### Test Coverage
- ‚úÖ Unit tests for detection, extraction, and metadata
- ‚úÖ Integration test with mocked RAG data
- ‚úÖ Backward compatibility tests
- ‚úÖ Demo script for visual validation

### Test Results
```
Unit tests:     5/5 PASSED ‚úÖ
Integration:    PASSED ‚úÖ
Demo:           Working correctly ‚úÖ
```

## Backward Compatibility

‚úÖ **Fully maintained** - All existing query types work as before:
- Simple queries (e.g., "What is NVIDIA's revenue?")
- Comparative queries without follow-up (e.g., "Which company had highest margin?")
- Multi-company analysis
- Temporal analysis

Only compound queries with specific pattern (comparative + pronoun + AI intent) trigger iterative flow.

## Acceptance Criteria

All criteria from the problem statement are met:

‚úÖ System runs comparative revenue sub-queries across MSFT, GOOGL, NVDA  
‚úÖ System determines company with highest revenue  
‚úÖ System appends and executes "{WINNER} ai strategy {year}"  
‚úÖ Final JSON `sub_queries` includes all four queries in execution order  
‚úÖ Backward compatibility preserved for simple/single-intent queries  
‚úÖ Testing verifies complete functionality  

## How to Test

### Quick Test
```bash
python test_integration_compound.py
```

### Full Test Suite
```bash
python test_compound_query.py
python test_integration_compound.py
python demo_compound_query.py
```

### With Real Data (if available)
```python
from src.agents.enhanced_rag import EnhancedRAGPipeline
import json

pipeline = EnhancedRAGPipeline()
query = "Which company had the highest revenue in 2024? What are the main AI risks of that company?"
result = pipeline.query(query, return_json=True)
print(json.dumps(result, indent=2))
```
